# OSI-VPT

This project is conceptualized to make a mobile app and upload all the project details (of all the villages) for any year along with the financial records (Amount of fund allocated for each project).

The access of this application will be shared to all the common villagers who wish to contribute in monitoring progress of different projects.

Whenever, any user of the app login, the  app must be able to track his location and display all the projects following within his gram panchayat area, suppose there are 80 projects in progress all should be visible to him.   

Now he will have the liberty to select any project and vote (if project is completed within the financial year) / comment if the financial year is still in progress.
